# DietCode

Optimize your coding-agent sessions with **DietCode** — automatic context compression, conversation summarization, intent-aware tool routing, and named entity extraction, powered by [Scaledown](https://scaledown.ai).

## What it does

Every time you submit a prompt, the plugin (via hooks in Claude Code and Codex CLI, or via rules guidance in Cursor):

1. **Classifies your intent** and prepends a one-line hint (e.g. `[DietCode intent: file_read (87%)]`) so the agent picks the right tool without guessing
2. **Compresses large contexts** automatically when you paste in a big codebase and ask a retrieval-style question — reducing token usage by 50–70% before the prompt reaches the model
3. **Compresses large tool outputs** (`PostToolUse`) — `ls`, `grep`, `git diff/log/status` are structurally compacted with zero latency, and anything still large is run through Scaledown before it enters context
4. **Tracks token savings** — every compression/summarization is counted, shown live in the Claude Code status line (`↓ 125.4K saved · 747 reqs`)

And — the big one for **real, per-turn token savings** — an optional **proxy mode**:

5. **Progressive compaction via proxy** (`dietcode claude`) — runs Claude Code through a local proxy that rewrites the **outgoing** request on every turn, keeping a running **Scaledown summary** of older turns so the context genuinely *shrinks* instead of growing. This is the only mode that actually reduces tokens (hooks can only *add* context), and it replaces Claude's own lossy auto-compaction. See [Proxy mode](#proxy-mode-real-token-savings).

> **Why not a `PreCompact` hook?** Claude Code's `PreCompact` hook can't replace the compaction summary or remove anything from the window — it can only append (see [anthropics/claude-code#24965](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/24965)). Injecting a summary there *costs* tokens rather than saving them, so the real work happens in the proxy, where DietCode controls the request payload.

On top of that, your agent gains tools it can call on demand in **all three clients**:

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `sd_compress` | Compress a large context block before a needle-in-a-haystack query |
| `sd_summarize` | Abstractively summarize text to compact long conversations |
| `sd_classify` | Classify text against custom labels (bug vs. feature vs. question) |
| `sd_extract` | Extract named entities or structured data from any text |
| `sd_retrieve` | Pull back the original text behind a proxy summary marker (reversibility) |

> **Status line / savings display is Claude Code only.** Cursor and Codex CLI have no status-line API, so token savings still happen there but aren't displayed. This is an npm CLI plugin — there is no VS Code/IDE extension; the "status line" refers to Claude Code's terminal status line.

---

## How it works (30 seconds)

```
your prompt ──▶ [intent classify] ──▶ [needle-in-haystack?] ──▶ compress ──▶ agent
                     │                        │
                 one-line hint          /compress/raw/  (50-70% smaller)
```

- **Intent hints** route the agent to the right tool, cheaply, on every prompt.
- **Auto-compression** only fires on prompts that are both *large* and
  *retrieval-intent*. Conversational prompts and code you're asking it to write
  are left untouched.
- **On-demand tools** give you manual control in any client.

---

## Proxy mode (real token savings)

Hooks can only *add* context to the window — they can never rewrite the
conversation history Claude re-sends every turn. So the only way to genuinely
**reduce** tokens (and to actually replace Claude's compaction) is to sit in the
request path. That's what proxy mode does.

```bash
dietcode claude        # = claude, but routed through DietCode's local proxy
```

This starts a tiny local proxy on `127.0.0.1` (ephemeral port, torn down when
you quit), points Claude Code at it via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, and launches
`claude` normally. On every request the proxy rewrites the outgoing payload:

```
[ system + tools ]                 ← untouched (keeps Anthropic's prompt cache warm)
[ running Scaledown summary ]      ← stands in for older turns; extended only at compaction steps
[ last N turns verbatim ]          ← the live working set
```

- **Progressive, not per-call.** Most turns make **zero** Scaledown calls — the
  proxy just reuses the cached running summary. Only when (summary + recent turns)
  crosses `SCALEDOWN_PROXY_COMPACT_THRESHOLD` does it make **one** call to fold
  the oldest turns into the summary. Cadence ≈ how often Claude would compact.
- **Replaces native compaction.** Because the forwarded payload stays small, the
  usage Claude Code sees stays low, so its own auto-compaction effectively never
  fires — Scaledown owns compaction instead.
- **Reversible.** Compacted turns are stashed locally; a summary marker tells
  Claude to call `sd_retrieve("<id>")` if it later needs an exact detail.
- **Cache-safe.** The summary block is byte-stable between compaction steps, so
  the cached prefix keeps hitting; it only changes at a compaction step (when
  native compaction would have busted the cache anyway).
- **Fail-open.** Any transform/Scaledown error forwards the original request
  unchanged — the proxy never breaks or drops a request. With no API key it runs
  as a pure passthrough.

> **Claude Code only.** The proxy speaks the Anthropic Messages format. Codex CLI
> and Cursor are unaffected and keep using the hooks/rules described below.

**Make it the default.** `dietcode setup` offers (recommended) to alias `claude` →
`dietcode claude` in your shell config, so you don't have to remember the wrapper.
The alias is shell-only and the wrapper launches the real binary directly, so
there's no recursion; run the unwrapped CLI anytime with `command claude`.

**Knowing whether it's on.** The Claude Code status line tells you live: in a
proxy session it just shows your savings; in a plain `claude` session it appends
`DietCode compaction off` as a reminder. (The agent name stays `DietCode` either
way — it's static config and can't change per session.)

Prefer to manage it yourself? Run the proxy in the foreground and set the env var:

```bash
dietcode proxy --port 8788
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8788
claude
```

## Get started (60 seconds)

> **Supported clients:** Claude Code · Cursor · OpenAI Codex CLI
>
> The MCP tools (`sd_compress`, `sd_summarize`, `sd_classify`, `sd_extract`) work in all three clients. Automatic hooks (`UserPromptSubmit`, `PostToolUse`, `PreCompact`) work in Claude Code and Codex CLI. Cursor has no hook system — use the [Cursor rules](#cursor) to drive proactive tool use instead.

- Node.js 18 or later
- A Scaledown API key, free at [scaledown.ai/dashboard](https://scaledown.ai/dashboard)
- One of: [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) · [Cursor](https://cursor.com) · [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex)

### Claude Code (recommended)

```bash
npm install -g dietcode
dietcode setup
```

The setup wizard will:
1. Open your browser to get an API key
2. Ask you to paste the key (validated against the API before continuing)
3. Save it to your shell config (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, etc.) and to `~/.scaledown/config.json`
4. Register the MCP server with Claude Code (`claude mcp add --scope user`)
5. Write the `UserPromptSubmit`, `PostToolUse`, and `PreCompact` hooks, the **status line**, and the auto-compact threshold to `~/.claude/settings.json`
6. Offer (recommended) to alias `claude` → `dietcode claude` so [proxy mode](#proxy-mode-real-token-savings) is on by default
7. Optionally configure Codex CLI and/or Cursor if you answer **y** when prompted

Restart Claude Code and you're done.

<details>
<summary>Manual setup</summary>

**1. Clone and build**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/scaledown-team/DietCode
cd DietCode
npm install && npm run build
```

**2. Set your API key**
```bash
export SCALEDOWN_API_KEY="your-key-here"   # add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc to persist
```

**3. Register the MCP server**

Personal use (`~/.claude.json`):
```bash
claude mcp add dietcode --transport stdio \
  -- node /path/to/DietCode/dist/src/index.js
```

Team use (`.mcp.json`, commit this file):
```bash
claude mcp add dietcode --transport stdio --scope project \
  -- npx -y dietcode
```

**4. Add the hook** to `.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "dietcode-hook"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
If you cloned instead of installing globally, use the full path:
```json
"command": "node /path/to/DietCode/dist/hooks/user-prompt-submit.js"
```
</details>

### Cursor

```bash
npm install -g dietcode
```

**2. Set your API key**
```bash
export SCALEDOWN_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

Create `.cursor/mcp.json` (or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` for global use):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dietcode": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "dietcode"],
      "env": {
        "SCALEDOWN_API_KEY": "your-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Restart Cursor. The four tools appear in Agent mode.

**4. Restart Cursor.** The four DietCode tools will be available in Agent mode.

**5. (Recommended) Add Cursor rules**

Cursor has no hooks system, but you can give the agent behavioral guidance via `.cursor/rules/`:

```bash
# Global (applies to all projects)
mkdir -p ~/.cursor/rules
cp node_modules/dietcode/cursor-rules/dietcode.mdc ~/.cursor/rules/

# Or project-level
mkdir -p .cursor/rules
cp node_modules/dietcode/cursor-rules/dietcode.mdc .cursor/rules/
```

Or run `dietcode setup` and answer **y** when asked about Cursor — it writes the file for you.

This instructs the agent to call `sd_compress` before large file reads, `sd_summarize` after web fetches, and `sd_classify` at the start of ambiguous tasks.

---

### OpenAI Codex CLI

```bash
npm install -g dietcode
```

**2. Add the MCP server**
```bash
codex mcp add dietcode --env SCALEDOWN_API_KEY=your-key-here -- npx -y dietcode
```
This writes to `~/.codex/config.toml`:
```toml
[mcp_servers.dietcode]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "dietcode"]

[mcp_servers.dietcode.env]
SCALEDOWN_API_KEY = "your-key-here"
```

**3. Register automatic hooks**

Codex CLI supports the same hook events as Claude Code. Run the setup wizard and answer **y** when asked about Codex CLI — it appends the following to `~/.codex/config.toml` automatically:

```toml
# DietCode hooks — added by dietcode setup
[[hooks.UserPromptSubmit]]
[[hooks.UserPromptSubmit.hooks]]
type = "command"
command = "node \"/path/to/hooks/user-prompt-submit.js\""
timeout = 30
statusMessage = "DietCode: classifying intent..."

[[hooks.PostToolUse]]
[[hooks.PostToolUse.hooks]]
type = "command"
command = "node \"/path/to/hooks/post-tool-use.js\""
timeout = 30

[[hooks.PreCompact]]
[[hooks.PreCompact.hooks]]
type = "command"
command = "node \"/path/to/hooks/pre-compact.js\""
timeout = 60
```

> Note: Codex CLI's `PostToolUse` fires only for Bash tool events. File read and MCP tool outputs are not intercepted — those use the on-demand MCP tools instead.

**4. (Optional) Add AGENTS.md**

Copy the provided template to your project root so Codex knows to use DietCode tools proactively:

```bash
cp node_modules/dietcode/agents-md/AGENTS.md ./AGENTS.md
```

## Feature comparison

| Feature | Claude Code | Cursor | Codex CLI |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sd_compress` tool | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `sd_summarize` tool | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `sd_classify` tool | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `sd_extract` tool | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

¹ Cursor rules instruct the agent to call DietCode tools proactively — not a true hook, but effective in Agent mode.
² Codex CLI's `PostToolUse` fires only for Bash tool events, not file reads or MCP calls.
³ Cursor and Codex CLI expose no status-line API. Savings still accrue (tracked in `~/.scaledown/stats.json`) but there is no place to display them.
⁴ Proxy mode is opt-in via `dietcode claude` and is Claude Code only (it speaks the Anthropic Messages API). See [Proxy mode](#proxy-mode-real-token-savings).

## Usage

**Automatic (Claude Code hook):** nothing to do; the hook fires on every prompt:
```
[DietCode intent: search (82%)]
Find all places where we call the payments API
```

**On-demand tools:** ask the agent directly:
```
Use sd_compress to compress this before searching through it: [paste large codebase]
Use sd_summarize to condense this thread so we can keep working
Use sd_classify to categorize these GitHub issues as bug, feature, or question
Use sd_extract to pull function names, file paths, and error codes from this stack trace
```

---

## Configuration

### Changing your API key

Re-run setup to replace the key automatically:
```bash
dietcode setup
```

Or edit your shell config directly:
```bash
# Open ~/.zshrc (or ~/.bashrc)
# Find and update:
export SCALEDOWN_API_KEY="sk-your-new-key"

# Reload
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Environment variables

Set these environment variables to tune behavior:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SCALEDOWN_API_KEY` | — | **Required.** Your Scaledown API key |
| `SCALEDOWN_COMPRESS_THRESHOLD` | `10000` | Token estimate above which prompt auto-compression fires |
| `SCALEDOWN_COMPRESS_RATE` | `0.3` | How aggressively to compress (`0.3` = keep ~30% of tokens; `auto` lets the API decide) |
| `SCALEDOWN_NIAH_DISABLE` | `false` | Set to `true` to compress all large prompts, not just retrieval-style ones |
| `SCALEDOWN_POST_TOOL_DISABLE` | `false` | Set to `true` to disable `PostToolUse` tool-output compression |
| `SCALEDOWN_POST_TOOL_THRESHOLD` | `4000` | Token threshold above which tool output is sent to the API (after structural filtering) |
| `SCALEDOWN_COMPACT_THRESHOLD` | `50` | Context-usage % that triggers compaction (also sets `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE`) |
| `SCALEDOWN_SHOW_PROGRESS` | `true` | Set to `false` to hide the per-prompt context progress bar |
| `SCALEDOWN_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` | `200000` | Context-window size used for the progress bar / compaction math |
| `SCALEDOWN_PROXY_COMPACT_THRESHOLD` | `50000` | Tokens (summary + recent turns) that trigger a proxy compaction step. Keep below the native auto-compact trigger so the proxy compacts first |
| `SCALEDOWN_PROXY_RECENT_TURNS` | `4` | Number of most-recent turns the proxy keeps verbatim |
| `SCALEDOWN_PROXY_PORT` | `8788` | Port for the foreground `dietcode proxy` (the `dietcode claude` wrapper uses an ephemeral port) |
| `SCALEDOWN_PROXY_UPSTREAM` | `https://api.anthropic.com` | Upstream the proxy forwards to |
| `SCALEDOWN_PROXY_DISABLE` | `false` | Set to `true` to make the proxy a pure passthrough (no compaction) |

```bash
export SCALEDOWN_COMPRESS_THRESHOLD=5000
export SCALEDOWN_COMPRESS_RATE=0.2
```

---

## Updating

```bash
npm update -g dietcode
# or
npm install -g dietcode@latest
```

Your harness config (hooks, status line, Cursor/Codex blocks) is **automatically re-synced on update** for every harness you've already set up — you do not need to re-run setup. This happens two ways:

- A **postinstall** step runs right after `npm install`.
- A **once-a-day self-heal** runs from the Claude Code status line as a safety net (e.g. if `npm install --ignore-scripts` skipped postinstall, or your Node version changed and moved the global install path).

Reconcile only touches harnesses you've already configured — it never adds a harness you didn't opt into, and it preserves your own keys/sections. To force a re-sync immediately:

```bash
dietcode-reconcile
```

> The status line also shows when a new version is available and auto-updates minor versions in the background; major versions print the upgrade command.

---

## Uninstalling

Remove all DietCode integration from every configured harness with one command:

```bash
dietcode uninstall
```

This strips the hooks, status line, and auto-compact env var from `~/.claude/settings.json`, removes the managed block from `~/.codex/config.toml`, deletes `~/.cursor/rules/dietcode.mdc`, removes the `claude` → `dietcode claude` shell alias, and unregisters the MCP server from Claude Code — all while preserving any of your own config in those files.

Then remove the package and (optionally) your data:

```bash
npm uninstall -g dietcode
rm -rf ~/.scaledown          # API key + saved-token stats (optional)
```

Finally, delete the two lines the installer added to your shell config (`~/.zshrc` / `~/.bashrc`):

```bash
export SCALEDOWN_API_KEY="..."
export CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE=50
```

**Per-harness manual removal** (if you prefer to do it by hand, or set up MCP manually):

| Harness | What to remove |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `hooks` (UserPromptSubmit/PostToolUse/PreCompact) + `statusLine` + `env.CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE` from `~/.claude/settings.json`; `claude mcp remove --scope user dietcode` |
| Cursor | Delete `~/.cursor/rules/dietcode.mdc` (or `.cursor/rules/dietcode.mdc`); remove the `dietcode` entry from `.cursor/mcp.json` |
| Codex CLI | Remove the `# DietCode hooks` block and `[mcp_servers.dietcode]` from `~/.codex/config.toml` |

---

## How compression works

Kode uses a local heuristic to detect "needle-in-a-haystack" queries: prompts
that are both large *and* retrieval-intent (`find`, `search`, `where`,
`what does ... do`, etc.). When detected, the prompt is sent to Scaledown's
`/compress/raw/` endpoint, which rewrites it into a semantically equivalent but
much shorter form before the agent sees it. Long conversational prompts (e.g. code
you're asking it to write from scratch) are left alone.

---

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scaledown-team/DietCode
cd DietCode
npm install
npm test          # unit tests
npm run build     # compile TypeScript
```

Test the hook:
```bash
echo '{"prompt":"find the function that handles auth"}' \
  | SCALEDOWN_API_KEY=your-key node dist/hooks/user-prompt-submit.js
```

Test the MCP server starts:
```bash
SCALEDOWN_API_KEY=test echo '{}' | node dist/src/index.js
```
